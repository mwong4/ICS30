    By convention, a tower of exponents $a^{b^c}$ in mathematics is always interpreted as $a^{(b^c)}$. In other words, exponents are right-associative. The reason for this is that the left-associative interpretation $(a^b)^c$ canbe expressed more simply as $a^{b \times c}$, by the laws of exponents.
